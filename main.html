    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input. The goal is to design algorithms that are efficient in terms of time, meaning they should run faster as the input size increases. Understanding time complexity helps us determine whether an algorithm will perform well for large datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It is essential to consider Space Complexity when working with large datasets, as inefficient memory usage can cause a program to run out of memory. The most common notation used for Space Complexity is O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
